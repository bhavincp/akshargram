            Small scale organic family farms struggle when up against the conventional agro-industrial market.
            After realizing we were not alone in this predicament, we joined with other farms to create a
            cooperative to: <br/> <br/>
              Support organic farmers through a community-based market for their crops. <br/>
              Encourage more small farmers to grow food sustainably, by supporting them during
              the difficult transition process. <br/>
              Make healthy, natural local food available and affordable for as many eaters as
              possible, along with outreach to more and more people who might not be as aware of
              what they're eating. <br/>
              Encourage a direct relationship between growers and eaters, so that non-farmers can
              also connect to the cycle of life that provides their food. <br/>
            </p>

            <p>
            Today, this co-operative provides local organic food through the Akshar Haat stores,
            each one run by farmers and their families. The food is sold under the name Aahar, and
            is also available for distribution in other stores, not just at Akshar Haat. Aahar is a
            community, not an institutional certification. All memebers know and support each other,
            solve problems together, and ensuer that there is sincerity and honesty behind all the food items.
