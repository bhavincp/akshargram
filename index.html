            <p> <b> Dear People  NAMASTEY</b><br/>
              Have you ever thought what type of food do you intake daily? <br/><br/>

                Organic Food obtained vide natural farming will make our body and mind healthy
                and will also be beneficial in many ways.<br/>
                Extreme Usage of Chemical based Fertilizer and Poisonous Pesticides has made our
                soil lifeless and by complete organic farming we are reviving our mother-soil.<br/>
                We, in every day diet/food, should avoid chemical-poisonous food and instead take
                organically produced thus motivating our farmers to go back, with pride, towards
                natural farming.<br/>
                Farmers and Consumers who are anxious, sensible & dedicated should awake, unite
                and make forum to become a precedent for the health and environment of the general
                public.<br/>
                Let us build a direct and cordial relationship between the businessman (farmer of
                organic farm) and consumer and resist farmers, who are lost towards advanced and
                chemical fertilizer farming, bring them back and realize the true image of the world
                with your kind co-operation.<br/> </p>
