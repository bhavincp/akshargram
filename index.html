            <p> <b> Dear People  NAMASTEY</b><br/>
              Have you ever thought what type of food do you intake daily? <br/><br/>

                Organic Food obtained vide natural farming will make our body and mind healthy
                and will also be beneficial in many ways.<br/>
                Extreme Usage of Chemical based Fertilizer and Poisonous Pesticides has made our
                soil lifeless and by complete organic farming we are reviving our mother-soil.<br/>
                We, in every day diet/food, should avoid chemical-poisonous food and instead take
                organically produced thus motivating our farmers to go back, with pride, towards
                natural farming.<br/>
                Farmers and Consumers who are anxious, sensible & dedicated should awake, unite
                and make forum to become a precedent for the health and environment of the general
                public.<br/>
                Let us build a direct and cordial relationship between the businessman (farmer of
                organic farm) and consumer and resist farmers, who are lost towards advanced and
                chemical fertilizer farming, bring them back and realize the true image of the world
                with your kind co-operation.<br/> </p>

            <p> Most of us like to believe we live a civilization that has made progress over generations.
              But is our vision of progress a world in which cancer rates are rising alarmingly, fertile farmland is rapidly
              being desertified, and rural families, finding it almost impossible to sustain themselves,
              are being driven to urban slums with inhumane conditions? These are just a few of the
              problems stemming from the conventional chemical agro-industry of today.</p>

            <p> The good news is that we don't have to do it this way....</p>
            <p> In fact, no one did until very recently. And some of us, fortunately,still don't.
              We at Akshar Gram work to rebuild our relationship to what we eat and how it grows.
              We do this by:<br/><br/>
                Regenerating the soil that sustains us, through natural composts and manures instead
                of chemical fetilizers and pesticides.<br/>
                Growing Crop varities adapted to the local environment, in their appropriate season.<br/>
                Avoiding monoculture to reduce vulnerability to pests and disease.<br/>
                Using human labour to reduce petroleum dependence and CO2 emission and provide work that
                makes rural life viable.
