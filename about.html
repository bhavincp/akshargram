          <content>
            <p> Most of us like to believe we live a civilization that has made progress over generations.
              But is our vision of progress a world in which cancer rates are rising alarmingly, fertile farmland is rapidly
              being desertified, and rural families, finding it almost impossible to sustain themselves,
              are being driven to urban slums with inhumane conditions? These are just a few of the
              problems stemming from the conventional chemical agro-industry of today.</p>

            <p> The good news is that we don't have to do it this way....</p>
            <p> In fact, no one did until very recently. And some of us, fortunately,still don't.
              We at Akshar Gram work to rebuild our relationship to what we eat and how it grows.
              We do this by:<br/><br/>
                Regenerating the soil that sustains us, through natural composts and manures instead
                of chemical fetilizers and pesticides.<br/>
                Growing Crop varities adapted to the local environment, in their appropriate season.<br/>
                Avoiding monoculture to reduce vulnerability to pests and disease.<br/>
                Using human labour to reduce petroleum dependence and CO2 emission and provide work that
                makes rural life viable.
